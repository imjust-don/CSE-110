    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose here for our website is to generate both general awareness and information about us and our company. In hopes that we might be able to generate more revenue
        We need this website because without it our ability to comunicate with potential customers is severly limited.
        This website would be a place for us to compile everthing a customer would need to know about us 
        so that we can provide them the service.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>This is for the people who might be interested in white water rafting but more specificly those who are interested in the services we provide as a rafting company
        And we will design our page to appeal to those people. We can do this by using fun fonts an colors
        water inspired color pallet and a straigh forward user interface. These people would be young thrill seakers
        looking for adventure. Financial status might be a little low and they want to go rafting. More than likely they'd be using smart phones
        and desktops to acces our site.

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
