        <h2>Brandon</h2>
        <p>    My name is Brandon. I'm originally from American Fork Utah. But most recently from the middle of nowhere Grand Forks North Dakota. I'm currently working on my computer and electrical engineering Degree. Some of my hobbies include photography, videography, and almost anything outdoors. I especially love motorsports (motorcycles, 4 wheelers, boating so on and so forth). I think that knowing things about web design can be super beneficial because I find it really fun and interesting but it also looks good on any job resume. I mostly just want to learn more and advance my skills in HTML and web development. I enjoy building servers and websites and thought that it would be a fun way to learn more and get some college credit.</p>
