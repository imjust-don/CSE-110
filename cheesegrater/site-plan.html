      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My sites purpose is to act as a hub between my servers and their functions such as my media server and 
        file server. It should make accessing them easier without having to memorize a bunch of sub domains.
        It should would put everything under one umbrella.

        and use them. Such as family friends.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        My website exists for a very specific purpose that will not appeal to the general population. It will serve as a hub for the different applications and services my personal home server provides. I plan to have multiple links and windows throughout the website so that I can easily access the different functions of my home server. I may even have different links to the different applications so that my users don't have to remember the different individual subdomains.

My goal is to make the website as interactive as possible. I want to make it easy for my users to access all the different functions of my home server in one convenient location. In addition to providing access to my home server, the website will also feature pages dedicated to discussing my home server and the different nodes that weâ€™ve created.

As for the types of activities visitors will want to complete on my site, the main focus will be accessing the different functions of my home server. By making it easy for users to access everything in one place, I hope to save them time and energy that would otherwise be spent navigating multiple subdomains.

In terms of the information necessary to complete any actions my site offers, users will need access to my home server's applications and services, as well as the necessary login credentials. (per individual application) They will also need to be familiar with the different nodes and how they function. Again this is specifically tailored to my friends and family that have access to this server.

      <h3>The creation</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to serving as a hub for my personal home server, the website will also provide valuable information for visitors who are interested in building their own home server. I plan to include a page that discusses the benefits of having a home server and provides guidance on how to build one. This page will feature some of the general steps I went through to build it. Including some of the hardware and the initial inspiration for the project.

I don't expect a large number of people to visit my website, as it caters to a very specific audience. However, I believe that those who do visit will find it to be a valuable resource. By offering easy access to my home server's applications and services, as well as providing some general information on how to build a home server yourself, I hope to establish my website as a good resource for those interested in personal home servers.

      </ul>
      <h3>About info</h3>
      <p>
        One page will focus on my home server itself, detailing its specs and how we went about creating it. I also plan to share some of the files I used during the build, including the HTML for this very website, which visitors will be able to download. The page will also feature a general account of the entire process, giving visitors a rough idea of how to go about building their own home server. I hope to also include some information about me and my friend who helped build it.
